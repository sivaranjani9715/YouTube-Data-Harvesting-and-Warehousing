YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING AND WAREHOUSING

PROJECT TITLE :
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit

DOMAIN :
SOCIAL MEDIA

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem statement is to create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels

APPROACH:
1. Setting up a Streamlit app:
Streamlit is a great choice for building data visualization and analysis tools quickly and easily.
We can use Streamlit to create a simple UI where users can enter a YouTube channel ID, view the channel details, and select channels to migrate to the data warehouse.
2. Connecting to the YouTube API:
We will need to use the YouTube API to retrieve channel and video data.
we can use the Google API client library for Python to make requests to the API.
3. Storing data in a MongoDB data lake:
After retrieving the data from the YouTube API, we should store it in a MongoDB data lake.
MongoDB is a great choice for a data lake because it can handle unstructured and semi-structured data easily.
4. Migrating data to a SQL data warehouse:
After collecting data of multiple channels, we should migrate it to a SQL data warehouse.
We can use a SQL database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for this.Here we have used MySQL
5. Query the SQL data warehouse:
We can use SQL queries to join the tables in the SQL data warehouse and retrieve data for specific channels based on user input.
We can use a Python SQL library such as SQLAlchemy to interact with the SQL database.
6. Displaying data in the Streamlit app:
Finally,we display the retrieved data in the Streamlit app.
We can use Streamlit's data visualization features to create charts and graphs to help users analyze the data.

DEVELOPER GUIDE:
TOOLS:

YouTube API Key

Python 3.11.0 or higher.

PyCharm

MySQL

MongoDB

Streamlit

SKILLS:

Python scripting

API integration

Data Collection

Data Management using MongoDB and SQL

USER GUIDE:

STEP 1: CHANNEL ID
Obtain the channel id from the channel for which the data to retrieved.

STEP 2: DATA ZONE
COLLECT TAB
Enter the channel id in the Enter the Channel id input box in COLLECT TAB
After entering the channel id, click on the Retrieve and Store data button to retrieve and store data to MongoDB.

EXTRACT TAB

The retrieved channel name appears in the dropdown in the extract tab.
Select the channel
Click on the Migrate to MySQL button.
Data will be migrated from MongoDB to MySQL.

STEP 3 : ANALYSIS ZONE
Click on the check box to check the updation of the channel
On clicking the check box, it will display the channels stored.

STEP 4 : QUERY ZONE
Queries were displayed in the dropdown
Select the queries in the dropdown
Results were displayed based on the analysis done.


RESULT:
Developing a user-friendly Streamlit application that enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app.
